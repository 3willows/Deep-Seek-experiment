Trying out Deep Seek: [write-up](https://programming-blog.3willows.xyz/post/2025-01-27-deep-seek/)

## Potential areas of improvement:

- Use an API to find all the public holidays, don't hard code it.
- Add tests
- Display date of the week next to the input box
- Prompt or reminder the user when Saturday / a public holiday chosen as hearing date
- Print/save option
- Improve loading spinner
- How to collect comments
- Think about correct treatment of old calendar images
